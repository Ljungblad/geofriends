>School project where the assigment was to develop a new website for Gundla Gårdscafé and their business. The customer wanted a simplistic design with an easy way of editing the content on the website without coding. For editing the content we chose [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), a headless CMS with an easy and customizable user interface. The website is live at this [link](https://gundlagards-cafe.vercel.app/).
